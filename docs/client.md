# Client

Build instructions are in [development.md](development.md). JKR needs an installed
Jedi Academy `GameData` directory with the retail `base/assets*.pk3` files.

## Launch

Open the main menu using an explicit content environment:

```sh
JKR_GAME_DATA=/path/to/GameData ./target/release/jkr-viewer
```

Join a server directly:

```sh
./target/release/jkr-viewer /path/to/GameData --connect 127.0.0.1:29071
```

The no-argument launch also checks the saved game-data location and known install
locations. Positional launch accepts a map path and optional player-model directory;
it is a direct world/viewer launch, whereas no arguments opens the main menu.
See [launch.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/launch.rs) and
[app_launch.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/app_launch.rs).

The client has a server browser, player and settings screens, in-game menus,
console, HUD, screenshots, demo recording/playback and a Create game flow.
Presence here describes implemented surfaces; validation limits are in
[status.md](status.md).

Create game starts a child `jkr-dedicated`, normally found beside the client.
Set `JKR_DEDICATED` to its executable path if installed elsewhere. The child
lifetime is managed by the client and defaults to local access; see
[local_server.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/local_server.rs).

## Joining and changing maps

The menu's FFA3 gate opens onto the prepared destination world. Map preparation
and connection run independently: when the world is ready first, you can walk,
jump and crouch locally while the connection finishes. A matching verified world
is reused when the server session becomes ready; joining does not build it twice.
The opening and crossing animation takes about 2.1 seconds once the destination
is ready. The gate stays closed while required content is unavailable. The
existing connection notice shows the server address/status and Cancel action
over the gate during joining; it disappears when the destination is entered.

On a server map change, gameplay pauses and a loading notice is shown over the
previous view until the destination and a fresh active snapshot are ready. The
client then adopts the server's spawn state. Match-end intermission uses the
server's normal camera, scoreboard and ready-to-exit controls. Player bodies and
vehicles are hidden there, matching codemp; scripted non-vehicle NPCs remain visible. Local gameplay
continuation on the old map is suspended while that feature is developed further.
The viewer no longer prepares an in-process native game for every loaded world.

CPU map preparation and GPU resource installation remain on background workers,
using the existing GPU context. Archive checksum inventory reads ZIP directories
without decompressing every asset. Matching same-map restarts can still reuse
the prepared world, and the gate adopts its already-built destination. The
waiting connection sends neutral commands during map loading and is kept separate
from the displayed old world, so new-map entities cannot appear in the wrong BSP.
Texture mip preparation and lamp extraction use bounded CPU workers; repeated
texture loads can reuse a bounded process-local mip cache. See
[load-time rendering preparation](rendering.md#load-time-texture-and-light-preparation)
for cache limits and unchanged output semantics. The gate animation and server
readiness still contribute to the time before play begins.

First entry through the gate before a server player exists retains movement-only
exploration with frozen brush collision. The gate's through-door view uses the
existing lightweight rendering path; full lighting begins when the destination
becomes the active world.

Server console output (`print`) goes exclusively to the console, including match
statistics, command replies and server announcements. It never enters chat history.
Global, team and private chat retain their conversation overlay. Center-print
gameplay notices keep their separate HUD presentation. The scoreboard continues
to use structured server scores rather than parsing printed statistics tables.

Chat remains connected to the real server during intermission, including
global/team/private composer messages and console/bound chat commands. Messages
received during background loading are retained; its loading notice hides the HUD. The scoreboard reserves a separate left column for messages and the
composer, temporarily overriding chat position/width while scores are visible.
Chat visibility/lifetime settings still apply. Typing captures gameplay input as
usual, and the ordinary chat layout returns after the scoreboard closes.

Escape opens the normal menu during exploration. Disconnect/cancel abandons the
pending connection and restores the retained main-menu world. Connection and asset
errors still show an error message. Downloads retain their existing policy and
limits; progress is available in the console. This does not eliminate disk,
shader, network or download latency, and direct command-line startup is separate
from the already-open menu's transition path.

Implementation: [resident worlds](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/resident_world.rs),
[early exploration](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/resident_walk.rs),
[world handoff](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/session_transition.rs) and
[gate destination](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/portal.rs).

Losing window focus releases held gameplay controls and discards gameplay actions
already queued for that frame. Synthetic key events on refocus cannot re-press a
held modifier such as Alt. This allows a saber throw already sent to the server
to finish normally after Alt+Tab.

## Configuration and content

The Linux configuration is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jkr/config.cfg`, falling back to
`~/.config/jkr/config.cfg`. The source also defines Windows `%APPDATA%` and macOS
Application Support locations in [platform.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/platform.rs).
Edit settings through the client, or edit the file while the client is stopped
so autosaving cannot overwrite your changes.

`fs_game`, `fs_basegame` and `fs_homepath` configure content search paths; restart
the client after changing them. Search precedence and shader protection are owned
by [asset_search_paths.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/asset_search_paths.rs).

Downloaded content is stored separately from the retail installation and config.
On Linux the default is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/jkr/downloads/base`, falling back to
`~/.local/share/jkr/downloads/base`. `JKR_DOWNLOAD_HOME` overrides the download
root (the implementation appends `base`). See
[download_store.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/download_store.rs).

## Useful console commands

Printable console shortcuts open the console but type normally once it is open;
Escape and non-text toggle bindings can still close it. `^` is a literal colour
prefix in the console and its browser, including on layouts that report it as a
dead key, so `set name "^1Bishop"` does not close the console or lose the digit.
Console transitions and literal dead-key `^` input clear the window's pending
accent composition. Other dead keys retain normal accent composition.

`connect host:port`, `disconnect` and `reconnect` control the session.
`record`, `stoprecord`, `demo` and `playdemo` control demos.
`screenshot` and `screenshotJPEG` request captures; `condump filename` saves
console output. See [console registration](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_session.rs)
and [file commands](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_files.rs) for argument handling.

The console input line has a caret, drawn as stock's underscore: Left and Right
move it, Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right by word, Home and End to either end, and Shift
with any of them selects. Backspace and Delete remove a character, or a word with
Ctrl; words end at anything but a letter or digit, so `cg_drawFPS` and
`127.0.0.1` are edited a piece at a time. Ctrl+A selects the line, Ctrl+X cuts,
and Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert pastes, replacing a selection. Typing inserts at the
caret, a long line scrolls sideways to keep it in view, and Enter runs the whole
line. Dragging the mouse over console output selects it, a double click selects
one whitespace-separated word (a whole `host:port`), Shift+click extends a
selection and a click elsewhere clears it; in the input line the mouse places the
caret and selects the same way. Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+Insert) copies selected output
without colour codes, else the selected input, else the whole input line, or the
last `viewpos` or `mark` answer when the line is empty. Up and Down stay history.
See [console_editing.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_editing.rs) and
[console_selection.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_selection.rs). The input
line and output rows are drawn and measured through one
[ConsoleText](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_text.rs) per text size, so the
caret, highlights and mouse hits follow the drawn glyphs at any size or letter
spacing.

Tab completes the command or cvar name being typed, after a leading `/` or `\` and
after the last `;`. A unique name completes with a trailing space; otherwise the
input extends to the longest shared prefix and the matching commands and cvars,
with cvar values, are listed. Up to 16 matches also show their descriptions;
longer listings end with the match count instead. Enter strips one leading `/` or
`\` from the line, then applies the same completion while `cl_allowEnterCompletion`
is set, without listing when the input is already a full name. Nothing strips a
slash on a command after `;`, so completing that command drops it. Command
boundaries follow the shell's quote and escape rules, and no completion happens
inside an open quote. Arguments are not completed. See
[shell_completion.rs](../crates/jkr-shell/src/shell_completion.rs).

F3 in the open console, or the bindable `consolebrowser` command, opens a browser of
every command and cvar with its description, and each cvar's value and default. Typing
searches names, then descriptions; Tab cycles All, Commands, Cvars and Changed (cvars
away from their default). Enter edits the selected cvar in place and applies it, or
starts a console line with the selected command; Delete restores a cvar's default;
Escape cancels an active edit first; otherwise Escape or F3 returns to the console.
The clickable Apply, Cancel and Filter controls follow the same actions as the
keyboard. Read-only cvars are listed but not edited. The
browser covers the whole frame: underlying menu shapes/text, chat and the FPS
counter are suppressed, including both font batches. See
[console_browser.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_browser.rs).
