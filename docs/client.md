# Client

Build instructions are in [development.md](development.md). JKR needs an installed
Jedi Academy `GameData` directory with the retail `base/assets*.pk3` files.

## Launch

Open the main menu using an explicit content environment:

```sh
JKR_GAME_DATA=/path/to/GameData ./target/release/jkr-viewer
```

Join a server directly:

```sh
./target/release/jkr-viewer /path/to/GameData --connect 127.0.0.1:29071
```

The no-argument launch also checks the saved game-data location and known install
locations. Positional launch accepts a map path and optional player-model directory;
it is a direct world/viewer launch, whereas no arguments opens the main menu.
See [launch.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/launch.rs) and
[app_launch.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/app_launch.rs).

The client has a server browser, player and settings screens, in-game menus,
console, HUD, screenshots, demo recording/playback and a Create game flow.
Presence here describes implemented surfaces; validation limits are in
[status.md](status.md).

Create game starts a child `jkr-dedicated`, normally found beside the client.
Set `JKR_DEDICATED` to its executable path if installed elsewhere. The child
lifetime is managed by the client and defaults to local access; see
[local_server.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/local_server.rs).

## Joining and changing maps

The menu's FFA3 gate opens onto the prepared destination world. Map preparation
and connection run independently: when the world is ready first, you can walk,
jump and crouch locally while the connection finishes. A matching verified world
is reused when the server session becomes ready; joining does not build it twice.
The opening and crossing animation takes about 2.1 seconds once the destination
is ready. The gate stays closed while required content is unavailable. The
existing connection notice shows the server address/status and Cancel action
over the gate during joining; it disappears when the destination is entered.

On a server map change, other players disappear while your player continues in
an in-process native game on the old map. The ordinary client pipeline still
presents your model, saber, weapons, HUD, animations and effects. Movement,
attacks, pickups and doors use the existing dedicated-server gameplay. The last
predicted player state seeds the continuation; after intermission, the last
pre-intermission player state supplies the playable pose instead of the frozen
intermission camera. Visible brush-door trajectories are carried across.
The handoff retains the local actor's animation tracks and uses one monotonic
local command/presentation timeline, without network drift adjustments. Remote
adoption starts fresh entity samples; a backwards server timestamp also retires
samples from the provisional server clock before applying the new snapshot.

The remote connection has its own command timer and stays separate from this
local authority. Local controls and position never go to the waiting server.
Once the destination and a fresh, active remote snapshot are ready, the client adopts
that world and the server's spawn state. Matching same-map restarts can reuse the
resident world. These paths have no separate loading screen.

This is a temporary local game, not a copy of a remote mod's hidden state. It
uses standard native game rules. Unreplicated script state, entity timers,
remote projectiles and other players are not imported; unseen map entities start
from their authored state, and an already-thrown saber returns to the hand at
handoff. Vehicles and custom scripted interactions need further verification.
Demo recording is unavailable during local continuation. First entry through
the gate before any server player exists still uses movement-only exploration
with frozen brush collision. If native world preparation fails, map-change
continuation also falls back to that path and reports the error in the console.
The gate's through-door view still uses the existing lightweight rendering path;
the full lighting path begins when the destination becomes the active world.

Escape opens the normal menu during exploration. Disconnect/cancel abandons the
pending connection and restores the retained main-menu world. Connection and asset
errors still show an error message. Downloads retain their existing policy and
limits; progress is available in the console. This does not eliminate disk,
shader, network or download latency, and direct command-line startup is separate
from the already-open menu's transition path.

Implementation: [resident worlds](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/resident_world.rs),
[local authority](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/resident_game.rs),
[early exploration](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/resident_walk.rs),
[world handoff](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/session_transition.rs) and
[gate destination](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/portal.rs).

Losing window focus releases held gameplay controls and discards gameplay actions
already queued for that frame. Synthetic key events on refocus cannot re-press a
held modifier such as Alt. This allows a saber throw already sent to the server
to finish normally after Alt+Tab.

## Configuration and content

The Linux configuration is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jkr/config.cfg`, falling back to
`~/.config/jkr/config.cfg`. The source also defines Windows `%APPDATA%` and macOS
Application Support locations in [platform.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/platform.rs).
Edit settings through the client, or edit the file while the client is stopped
so autosaving cannot overwrite your changes.

`fs_game`, `fs_basegame` and `fs_homepath` configure content search paths; restart
the client after changing them. Search precedence and shader protection are owned
by [asset_search_paths.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/asset_search_paths.rs).

Downloaded content is stored separately from the retail installation and config.
On Linux the default is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/jkr/downloads/base`, falling back to
`~/.local/share/jkr/downloads/base`. `JKR_DOWNLOAD_HOME` overrides the download
root (the implementation appends `base`). See
[download_store.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/download_store.rs).

## Useful console commands

`connect host:port`, `disconnect` and `reconnect` control the session.
`record`, `stoprecord`, `demo` and `playdemo` control demos.
`screenshot` and `screenshotJPEG` request captures; `condump filename` saves
console output. See [console registration](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_session.rs)
and [file commands](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/console_files.rs) for argument handling.

Tab completes the command or cvar name being typed, after a leading `/` or `\` and
after the last `;`. A unique name completes with a trailing space; otherwise the
input extends to the longest shared prefix and the matching commands and cvars,
with cvar values, are listed. Up to 16 matches also show their descriptions;
longer listings end with the match count instead. Enter strips one leading `/` or
`\` from the line, then applies the same completion while `cl_allowEnterCompletion`
is set, without listing when the input is already a full name. Nothing strips a
slash on a command after `;`, so completing that command drops it. Command
boundaries follow the shell's quote and escape rules, and no completion happens
inside an open quote. Arguments are not completed. See
[shell_completion.rs](../crates/jkr-shell/src/shell_completion.rs).
