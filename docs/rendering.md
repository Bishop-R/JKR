# Rendering and UI

The wgpu renderer lives in `jkr-viewer`. JKA content enters through owned BSP,
model and shader data; GPU resources stay in the viewer. The renderer consumes
BSP geometry, PVS visibility, lightmaps, shader stages and legacy models.

## Where to work

| Area | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| GPU/device setup | [gpu_context.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/gpu_context.rs) |
| World loading | [world_load.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_load.rs) |
| World materials | [world_materials.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_materials.rs) |
| Main scene passes | [main_scene_pass.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/main_scene_pass.rs) |
| Secondary views | [scene_views.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/scene_views.rs) |
| Sun and real-time lighting | [sun_shadows.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/sun_shadows.rs) |
| Post processing | [post_aa.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/post_aa.rs) |
| Frame timing | [frame_pacing.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/frame_pacing.rs) |
| HUD integration | [hud.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/hud.rs) |

The normal BSP path supports additional lighting, shadows, GI probes, ambient
occlusion, reflections and post processing. Feature presence does not establish
correctness on every map or GPU. Preserve the ordinary BSP/material path when
working on optional effects and validate shared WGSL programs on an actual GPU.

## Selected controls

| Cvar | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `jkr_dayNight` | Map-relative sun/sky atmosphere; default 0, restart required |
| `jkr_realtime` | Lighting tier; default 2. Tier 1 retains world shadow casters between frames; tier 0 also uses available baked indirect light. Applies at map load |
| `jkr_dayHour` | Solar hour, updated live when day/night resources are installed |
| `jkr_dayMinutes` | Minutes per simulated day; 0 holds the hour |
| `jkr_hdr` | Scene precision: 0 display format, 1 RGBA16F; restart required |
| `jkr_hdrExposure` | Fixed exposure multiplier, 0.25–4; restart required |

See [day_night.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/day_night.rs),
[sun_shadow_settings.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/sun_shadow_settings.rs) and
[post_hdr.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/post_hdr.rs). A lighting tier alone does not
enable the day/night system. HDR here describes the scene buffer and display
mapping, not a claim of HDR monitor output.

Sun-shadow filtering compensates for the receiver surface's slope across the
full texel footprint of a linear depth comparison. A half-texel allowance only
covers samples midway between texel centers and can produce bands of false
self-shadowing on flat surfaces. Keep this allowance tied to the cascade's
texel size and receiver slope; increasing a fixed world-space offset can detach
shadows from walls and ground contacts.

The full-footprint correction was checked against the preceding shader from
`4a8fe31` with external release captures on Linux/RADV (Radeon RX 9060 XT), at
1920×1080 with HDR, lighting tier 0, 2048-pixel shadow maps and a fixed 9:00 sun.
The reported `mp/ffa3` view and a nearby camera position lost the ground bands
while retaining the ship and wall shadows; an `mp/ffa1` interior comparison
showed no obvious regression. GPU frame means were 3.336 → 3.341 ms for the
nearby `ffa3` view and 4.122 → 4.125 ms for `ffa1` (64 measured frames each).
These isolated captures are not a full gameplay benchmark or coverage of every
map, sun angle, graphics backend or shadow quality setting.

Sun-shadow cascades share a world-space reconstruction footprint while blending.
The close transition covers the last half of its axial range; the view/far
transition covers the last quarter. The minimum footprint is based on 1.5 texels
of the active cascade, interpolated toward the finer map during a transition.
This avoids cross-fading independently sharp and soft versions of an edge.
The accepted transition refinement added approximately 0.074 ms of GPU work in
the marked 4K ship view on Linux/RADV (Radeon RX 9060 XT, tier 0, HDR,
2048-pixel shadow maps, 16 base taps, fixed 11:00 sun). It does not establish
complete temporal invariance.

Static world and moving casters now keep separate depths in the close and view
cascades. A nearby player cannot replace a distant building's depth in the world
filter's separation estimate. Receivers multiply the independently filtered
visibilities. This approximates their union; it is not exact area-light visibility
for multiple blocker depths. Volumetric lighting samples both depths at each tap.
Tiers 0/1 reuse the existing static maps without copying them under moving casters.
Tier 2 refreshes separate world maps each frame, adding two depth textures
(32 MiB at 2048 pixels, 128 MiB at 4096) and two render-pass boundaries.

World penumbra width still grows with caster-to-receiver separation. The blocker
search bilinearly reconstructs positive gaps and coverage from 16 positions,
correcting for the receiver plane at each texel. Its reach is 24 world units,
expanded if needed for the minimum reconstruction footprint; it no longer clips
the close cascade's broad penumbrae at twelve tiny shadow texels. Reconstruction
uses a truncated Gaussian disk to reduce the visible rim of an equal-weight disk.
`jkr_shadowTaps` (4–32) supplies the base count, with up to four times that budget
for broad filters and a fractional final tap for continuous count changes.
The full-texel slope correction and small normal offset remain unchanged.

Moving casters use the shared contact footprint, independently of the building's
penumbra. Their shadows therefore remain comparatively sharp even when a moving
caster is high above its receiver. Actor-only shadow mode retains separation-based
filtering. Neither approach resolves all shadow-map occlusion or sampling limits.

The preceding combined-map RMS filter was rejected in owner playtesting: the
reported ground-fixed boundary and player interaction remained visible, especially
when structures were far from the surface receiving their shadow. The current
separation/filter changes were checked at the third `mp/ffa3` mark
`(-425.691, -1061.451, 73.832)`, yaw `132.718`, pitch `38.102`, with an external
release harness carrying the production shadow code from the working tree based
on `980e693`. Linux/RADV captures on the same RX 9060 XT at 1080p and 4K,
HDR, tier 0, 2048 maps, 16 base taps and fixed 11:00 sun showed a smoother broad
edge. A frozen Kyle model was moved through seven positions in the actual dynamic
caster pass. GPU attribute readback found no visibility increase on unchanged
receivers when adding the actor (over 515,000 compared pixels per position).
The previous combined-map filter's maximum increase was only 0.000119 in this
particular probe; the more visible improvement is the distinct player shadow
instead of its inheriting the building's broad blur. This is not a complete
reproduction of every reported player interaction.

Earlier wall/ship views and a seven-position camera approach were also captured.
Tier 2, day/night disabled and actor-only modes passed GPU smoke checks. At 4K,
64-frame means compared with the preceding combined-map filter were
1.579 → 2.100 ms for the light pass and 4.212 → 4.700 ms for GPU work excluding
capture/readback, approximately 0.49 ms added. These are empty-scene measurements
on an active desktop, with release compilation running concurrently, not a
populated-match benchmark. Workspace build/tests, formatting and the production
release build passed; Cargo runs no bundled regression tests. The owner accepted
the release playtest on 2026-10-02. Broader live-animation checks, other GPUs and
exhaustive quality/map coverage remain open.

Set `JKR_FRAME_BUDGET=1` for frame-work and GPU-phase diagnostics. Measurements
must name the build mode, GPU, resolution, settings, map and population. Separate
loading/shader warmup from steady frames and CPU work from GPU timings. The
500+ FPS target remains open; neither a single GPU timestamp nor an uncapped
empty scene demonstrates it.

## Saber trails

[saber_trail.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_trail.rs) follows codemp
`CG_AddSaberBlade` and `CTrail`: every frame at least 3 ms after the last, a
blade adds one slice from its remembered muzzle and tip to the current ones.
A slice lives `trailLen / 5` ms of the current `saberMove` (30–40 ms for most
moves, 40 ms when the move authors none) and fades by scrolling the clamped
blur texture, not by alpha. The short visible arc is stock behavior; frame rate
changes the slice count, not the arc's duration. Slices split along new tip to
old muzzle as `CTrail::Draw` does. With `cg_saberContact` on, the tip stops at
the first world surface the blade enters
([saber_trail_edge.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_trail_edge.rs)); stock
also stops it at solid brush entities, which JKR does not trace yet. A flying
primary saber trails and shares the owner's blade state, as in stock. Not yet
drawn: the extra trails stock adds while `PW_SPEED` is set with `cg_speedTrail`
and during super-break win animations.

Blade/wall contact ([saber_contacts.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_contacts.rs))
plays a wall-hit sound once a blade has stayed in the wall since the previous
frame, at most every 100 ms per blade. Like stock's `S_StartSound(..., -1,
CHAN_WEAPON, ...)`, all wall hits share one source and channel, so each new hit
replaces the previous one instead of overlapping it.

## UI ownership

`jkr-ui` provides renderer-independent retained widgets. The viewer supplies GPU
and text integration and binds client state to the HUD. Layouts are data in
[assets/hud](../crates/jkr-viewer/assets/hud); menus and HUD may be modern while
movement, combat and network behavior remain compatible.
